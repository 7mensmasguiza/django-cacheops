## The Nanosuit
 
The Nanosuit is the signature feature of the Crysis series, and it gives the player a range of abilities and options to adapt to any situation. The Nanosuit has four modes: Armor, Stealth, Power, and Tactical. Each mode consumes energy that can be replenished by hiding or using energy cells.

- Armor mode increases the player's durability and reduces damage from bullets, explosions, and falls. It also stabilizes the aim and reduces recoil.
- Stealth mode renders the player invisible to enemies and reduces noise. It also allows the player to perform silent takedowns and hack enemy devices.
- Power mode enhances the player's strength and speed, allowing them to jump higher, run faster, punch harder, and throw objects farther.
- Tactical mode scans the environment and highlights enemies, weapons, ammo, objectives, and points of interest. It also allows the player to use visor functions such as zooming, tagging, and hacking.

The player can switch between modes at any time by using the mouse wheel or the keyboard. The player can also customize the Nanosuit's attributes and abilities by using Nanosuit upgrade kits found throughout the game.
 
## The Weapons
 
Crysis 3 offers a variety of weapons for the player to choose from, ranging from conventional firearms to futuristic alien weaponry. The player can carry two primary weapons and one secondary weapon at a time, as well as grenades and C4 explosives. The player can also modify their weapons by attaching scopes, silencers, extended magazines, lasers, and other accessories.
 
Some of the notable weapons in Crysis 3 are:

- The Predator Bow: A silent and deadly weapon that can fire different types of arrows, such as explosive, electric, airburst, and thermite. The bow can be used in stealth mode without draining energy.
- The Typhoon: A rapid-fire projectile minigun that can unleash a storm of bullets at a rate of 500 rounds per second. The Typhoon is effective against large groups of enemies or armored targets.
- The Ceph Plasma Destroyer: An alien weapon that fires powerful plasma bolts that can vaporize enemies or vehicles. The Plasma Destroyer has a high rate of fire and a large magazine capacity.
- The Reaper Cannon: Another alien weapon that fires large metal spikes that can impale enemies or objects. The Reaper Cannon has a slow rate of fire but a high damage output.

## The Environments
 
Crysis 3 is set in a post-apocalyptic New York City that has been transformed into an urban rainforest by the Ceph's terraforming device. The game features seven different environments that are collectively known as the Seven Wonders of Crysis 3. Each environment has its own unique characteristics and challenges for the player to explore and overcome.

- The Liberty Dome: The main setting of the game, where the remains of New York City are covered by a giant dome that protects the Ceph's Alpha Ceph. The Liberty Dome consists of various sub-environments such as Chinatown, Battery Park, Grand Central Station, Wall Street, and more.
- The Fields: A vast open area filled with tall grasses and crops that are used to feed the Ceph. The Fields are patrolled by Ceph stalkers and harvesters that can ambush the player at any moment.
- The Swamp: A wetland area that is flooded by water and infested by Ceph pingers and grunts. The Swamp requires the player to use stealth and mobility to avoid detection and navigate through the waterlogged terrain.
- The Dam: A massive hydroelectric dam that provides power to the Liberty Dome. The Dam is guarded by CELL soldiers and turrets that can pose a threat to the player from long distances.
- The Train Yard: A derelict railway station that is used as a base by CELL rebels. The Train Yard is filled with trains, containers, cranes, and other structures that can provide cover or vantage points for the player.
- The Pinch: A narrow canyon that leads to the Alpha Ceph's lair. The Pinch is surrounded by cliffs and rock formations that can collapse or explode due to the Alpha Ceph's influence.
