If you want to master Asphalt 2 Urban GT 3D, you might need some tips and tricks to improve your skills and beat your opponents. Here are some of them:
 
- Choose the right vehicle for each track. Different vehicles have different stats, such as speed, acceleration, handling, and nitro. You should pick the one that suits your driving style and the track conditions. For example, a fast car might be good for a straight track, but a nimble bike might be better for a twisty one.
- Use your nitro wisely. Nitro is a powerful boost that can help you overtake your rivals or escape from the cops. However, it is limited and takes time to recharge. You should use it when you really need it, such as when you are behind or when you see a ramp or a shortcut. You can also refill your nitro by performing stunts, drifts, or near misses.
- Customize your vehicle. You can change the color, decals, rims, and spoilers of your vehicle to make it look more stylish and unique. You can also upgrade your engine, brakes, suspension, and tires to improve your performance and handling. However, customization costs money, so you should save up for the parts you really want.
- Play multiplayer mode. Asphalt 2 Urban GT 3D supports multiplayer mode via Bluetooth, so you can race against your friends or other players nearby. This mode is more fun and challenging than playing against the AI, and you can also earn more money and reputation by winning races.

Asphalt 2 Urban GT 3D is a game that will keep you entertained for hours with its fast-paced action and stunning graphics. If you follow these tips and tricks, you will be able to enjoy the game even more and become a street racing legend.
