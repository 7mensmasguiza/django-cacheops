Charles Daly was a brand name for shotguns imported from various countries, including Belgium, Germany, Italy and Japan. One of the most well-known manufacturers of Charles Daly shotguns was Miroku, a Japanese company that also produces the Browning Citori line. Miroku made Charles Daly shotguns from the late 1960s to the early 1970s, and these guns are still highly regarded by collectors and shooters today.

- Look for the serial number on the receiver or the barrels. Miroku serial numbers usually start with a letter followed by six digits, such as A412158. The letter indicates the year of manufacture, with A being 1968, B being 1969, and so on. The serial number should match on all the parts of the gun.
- Look for the markings on the barrels. Miroku barrels should have "MIROKU FIREARMS MFG. CO.. KOCHI, JAPAN" on one side, and "12GA-2 3/4\"" or similar on the other. They may also have "BC MIROKU" in gold inlay on the bottom of the action frame.
- Look for the proof marks on the barrels. Miroku shotguns imported to the UK should have British proof marks, such as crossed swords with letters indicating the date and place of proofing. For example, Y & B in crossed swords mean Birmingham 1973.
- Look for the choke markings on the barrels. Miroku used symbols to indicate the choke constriction, such as + for full choke, +- for modified choke, ++ for improved cylinder choke, and so on.
- Look for the features of the gun. Miroku made several models and grades of Charles Daly shotguns, such as Superior, Diamond, Empire, Field and Skeet. Some of the features that can help you identify them are:
    - The width of the vent rib. Superior and Diamond grades had wide vent ribs (about 9mm), while Field and Skeet grades had narrow vent ribs (about 6mm).
    - The presence of a middle bead on the rib. Superior and Diamond grades had a small white bead near the middle of the rib, while Field and Skeet grades did not.
    - The shape of the fore-end. Superior and Diamond grades had a bulbous fore-end with a metal tip, while Field and Skeet grades had a slender fore-end with a wood tip.
    - The type of stock. Superior and Diamond grades had a Monte Carlo stock with a cheek piece and a recoil pad, while Field and Skeet grades had a straight stock with a butt plate.
    - The type of trigger. Superior and Diamond grades had a single gold trigger that could be selective or non-selective, while Field and Skeet grades had a single silver trigger that was non-selective.
    - The type of ejectors. Superior and Diamond grades had "Selexor" ejectors that could be switched to extractors by sliding switches on the sides of the frame, while Field and Skeet grades had automatic ejectors.
    - The type of engraving. Superior and Diamond grades had hand-engraved scrollwork on the frame and trigger guard, while Field and Skeet grades had machine-engraved scrollwork or none at all.

By following these tips, you should be able to identify your Charles Daly Bc Miroku shotgun with some degree of accuracy. However, keep in mind that there may be variations or exceptions among different guns, so it is always advisable to consult an expert or a reliable source for more information.
